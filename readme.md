#SuperJS Transform

> **Disclaimer:** SuperJS is under heavy development at the moment, and breaking changes are likely. The intent is
to publish a stable release during the first quarter of 2015.

Transforms enable you to change input parameters before validation, such as converting a request parameter to JSON. The library
also provides a mechanism to setup and process a group of transforms using the bluebird Promise Library.
